## Usage

1. **Submit a Claim:**
   - On the dashboard, enter a claim in the input field (e.g., "Intermittent fasting causes bloating") and click "Submit".
  
2. **Backend Processing:**
   - Your claim is sent to the backend at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/fact-check`.
   - The multi-agent system processes the claim: searching for evidence, scraping web pages, checking source reliability, and synthesizing a summary.
  
3. **Viewing Results:**
   - The dashboard displays a structured response that includes:
     - **Confidence Level**
     - **Key Findings** with relevance and source links
     - **List of Sources** with trust scores and reliability
     - **Summary** and overall verdict

  "summary": "The claim that Donald Trump lost the 2025 elections is supported by multiple fact-checking sources, including CNN and FactCheck.org. These sources verify that Trump won the 2024 election, contradicting the claim. The evidence is reliable, as it comes from reputable news organizations and fact-checking websites. However, the verification results indicate low credibility, primarily due to the lack of domain authority and citation count. The validation results reveal several logical fallacies, including false causality and appeal to emotion, which may indicate biased or misleading information. Despite these limitations, the overall confidence level is 0.8, indicating a moderate level of confidence in the final verdict. The final verdict is False, as the evidence overwhelmingly supports Trump's victory in the 2024 election.",
  "verdict": "False"
}


** ðŸ§  What This Shows
This example demonstrates how the system:

Accepts a claim as input.

Evaluates the truthfulness of that claim using external, reputable sources.

Interpretation:

Confidence Score: 0.8 â€” Moderate confidence in the verdict.

Verdict: False â€” The claim was determined to be incorrect.

Sources: All findings are backed by medium-reliability sources like CNN, PBS, and FactCheck.org.

Summary: The system explains why the claim was evaluated as false and highlights logical fallacies or bias where relevant.
